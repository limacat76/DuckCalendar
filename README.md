# DuckCalendar
Creating a pdf calendar using itext7

## What is it
Just an experiment to see if I could create a calendar application in pdf, while using C#.

## Limitations
Currently it's hardcoded to the italian festivities and the layout of fonts on my system, it should use your locale.
It should generate the current year calendar if the date is between the Jan 1 and the end of September, and the next year from October onwards

## Why AGPL?
Because itext7 is licensed under AGPL.
